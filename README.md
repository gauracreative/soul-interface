# Soul Interface

## Vedic concept of God and the Soul through OOP principles

It's made as a Laravel package and can actually be used as such (proof - [Soul Interface](https://soul-interface.gauracreative.com)), even though it's really build for education purposes.

As the title suggests, the main purpose of this is to give some of you computer geeks out there something else to wrap your minds around... if you also (occasionally) have questions about God, soul, karma, purpose of life, happiness and that sort of thing.


Have fun! ðŸ˜‰
